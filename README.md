# Diabot: The Flutter Dialogflow Bot

## About the Project
* The Flutter Dialogflow Agent, "DiaBot" is a cross-platform chatbot made using Flutter and Dialogflow.
* The application has been developed for the partial fulfillment of the requirements of Semester VII, B. Tech. Computer Science and Engineering. (Subject: Mobile Application Development, Subject Code: BTCS702).
